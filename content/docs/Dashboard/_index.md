**Dashboard** is the first page that appears when you log in to the **Alertlens** every time after the first login. Dashboard displays [**Alert History**](/docs/dashboard/alerts_history/) and **Time Window**. The Time Window displays the Alert History generated in that time frame.
By default, the Time Window is set for the last 6 hours.

### Time Window

You can change the Time Window by performing the following steps:

1.   Click the **Time Window** hyperlink on the right side of the screen.

      The list of options appears.

2.   Select the required option. For example, last 1 hour, last 2 days, and so on. For custom time window, select the **Custom** option.<br>
     A pop up appears.

4.   Set **Start Time** and **End Time** in the Calendar.

5.   Click the **Set** button.
