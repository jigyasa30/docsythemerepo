The notification is referred to as an alert and you can communicate it through multiple channels. Letâ€™s walk through the steps to set alert notifications:

1. Click the **gearbox** icon ![img](/gearbox.JPG) in the top right corner of the screen.

2. Select **Alert** -> **Notifications**.

3. Click the **Add** button to add the notifications.

   The **Add Notification channel** pop-up appears. **AlertLens** supports four notification channels:
   - [AWS SNS](/docs/settings/alert-notifications/aws_sns/)
   - [Email](/docs/settings/alert-notifications/email/)
   - [Pager Duty](/docs/settings/alert-notifications/pager_duty/)
   - [Slack](/docs/settings/alert-notifications/slack/)
   <br>
4. Choose **Type** of the notification channel.

   A pop up appears to configure the notification channel.

5. Set configuration values. For details, refer sections [AWS SNS](/docs/settings/alert-notifications/aws_sns/), [Email](/docs/settings/alert-notifications/email/), [Pager Duty](/docs/settings/alert-notifications/pager_duty/), and [Slack](/docs/settings/alert-notifications/slack/).

6. Click **Test** to make sure it works. Click **Save**.

   **Congrats!** The Alert Notification is created.
