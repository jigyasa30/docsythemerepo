Nokia Care Tool (NCT) is a Nokia Case handling Tool which is used to track the issues raised by the customer.
Smart tier-1 team receives the ticket and provides the Initial Response to the same. The T1 team then dispatches the case to concerned support team (L2 / L3, whichever applicable).
During analysis, if support team finds that the issue reported is a bug or a code then they raise the same with concerned L4 support (delivery team) team via Jira.
Workflow of NCT from case creation to case closure highlighting the L4 support is discussed in the subsequent sections.
